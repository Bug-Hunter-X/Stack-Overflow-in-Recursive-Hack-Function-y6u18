function foo(x: int): int {
  if (x == 0) {
    return 1;
  } else {
    return x * foo(x - 1);
  }
}

function bar(): void {
  echo foo(5);
}

This code will cause a stack overflow error if the input x is too large. This is because the recursive function foo calls itself repeatedly without a base case. The base case is when x is equal to 0. However, if x is large, this base case will not be reached, and the function will call itself indefinitely, leading to a stack overflow error.

To fix this bug, you can add a check to see if x is greater than a certain limit. If it is, then you can return a default value, such as 0.  Another solution is to rewrite the function iteratively instead of recursively.
